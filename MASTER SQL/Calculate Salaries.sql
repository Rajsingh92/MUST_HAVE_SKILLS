Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:
    0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than 1000$.
    24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
    49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than 10000$.

For company 1, Max salary is 21300. Employees in company 1 have taxes = 49%
For company 2, Max salary is 700. Employees in company 2 have taxes = 0%
For company 3, Max salary is 7777. Employees in company 3 have taxes = 24%
The salary after taxes = salary - (taxes percentage / 100) * salary
For example, Salary for Morninngcat (3, 15) after taxes = 7777 - 7777 * (24 / 100) = 7777 - 1866.48 = 5910.52, which is rounded to 5911.
