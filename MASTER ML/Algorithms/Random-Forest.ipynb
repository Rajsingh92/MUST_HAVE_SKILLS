    "## Introduction to Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests, also known as random decision forests, are a popular ensemble method that can be used to build predictive models for both classification and regression problems. Ensemble methods use multiple learning models to gain better predictive results — in the case of a random forest, the model creates an entire forest of random uncorrelated decision trees to arrive at the best possible answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how this works in practice — specifically in a classification context — I’ll be walking you through an example using a famous data set from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The data set, called the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, deals with binary classification and includes features computed from digitized images of biopsies. The data set can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow this tutorial, you will need some familiarity with classification and regression tree (CART) modeling. I will provide a brief overview of different CART methodologies that are relevant to random forest, beginning with decision trees. If you’d like to brush up on your knowledge of CART modeling before beginning the tutorial, I highly recommend reading Chapter 8 of the book “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R,” which can be downloaded [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are simple but intuitive models that utilize a top-down approach in which the root node creates binary splits until a certain criteria is met. This binary splitting of nodes provides a predicted value based on the interior nodes leading to the terminal (final) nodes. In a classification context, a decision tree will output a predicted target class for each terminal node produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although intuitive, decision trees have limitations that prevent them from being useful in machine learning applications. You can learn more about implementing a decision tree [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees tend to have high variance when they utilize different training and test sets of the same data, since they tend to overfit on training data. This leads to poor performance on unseen data. Unfortunately, this limits the usage of decision trees in predictive modeling. However, using ensemble methods, we can create models that utilize underlying decision trees as a foundation for producing powerful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bootstrap Aggregating Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a process known as bootstrap aggregating (or bagging), it’s possible to create an ensemble (forest) of trees where multiple training sets are generated with replacement, meaning data instances — or in the case of this tutorial, patients — can be repeated. Once the training sets are created, a CART model can be trained on each subsample.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps reduce variance by averaging the ensemble's results, creating a majority-votes model. Another important feature of bagging trees is that the resulting model uses the entire feature space when considering node splits. Bagging trees allow the trees to grow without pruning, reducing the tree-depth sizes and resulting in high variance but lower bias, which can help improve predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a downside to this process is that the utilization of the entire feature space creates a risk of correlation between trees, increasing bias in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Bagging Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of bagging trees is that it uses the entire feature space when creating splits in the trees. If some variables within the feature space are indicative of certain predictions, you run the risk of having a forest of correlated trees, thereby increasing bias and reducing variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a simple tweak of the bagging trees methodology can prove advantageous to the model’s predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest aims to reduce the previously mentioned correlation issue by choosing only a subsample of the feature space at each split. Essentially, it aims to make the trees de-correlated and prune the trees by setting a stopping criteria for node splits, which I will cover in more detail later."

    "\n",
    "Cross validation is a powerful tool that is used for estimating the predictive power of your model, and it performs better than the conventional training and test set. Using cross validation, we can create multiple training and test sets and average the scores to give us a less biased metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will create 10 sets within our data set that calculate the estimations we have done already, then average the prediction error to give us a more accurate representation of our model's prediction power. The model's performance can vary significantly when utilizing different training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Within a random forest context, if your data set is significantly large, you can choose to not do cross validation and instead use the OOB error rate as an unbiased metric for computational costs. But for the purposes of this tutorial, I included it to show the different accuracy metrics available."

Feature engineering would be a powerful tool for extracting information and moving forward into the research phase, and would help define key metrics to utilize when optimizing model parameters.\n",
