Equilibrium Point 

Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}
Output: 1
Explanation: Since its the only 
element hence its the only equilibrium 
point.
