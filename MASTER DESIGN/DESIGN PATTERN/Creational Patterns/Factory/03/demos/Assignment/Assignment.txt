You work for a customer service company. Your company has three categories of customers:
1. Small to medium businesses (SMB)
2. Enterprise businesses (ENT)
3. Government agencies and departments (GOV)

You've been asked to build a library to provide easy access to classes for all 
three types of customers.  The programs that will use your library must not know
any details of the implementations of those classes, but know that they all implement
one property and one method:
    Property: name, the name of the customer
    Method:   send_invoice(), a method to send an invoice to the customer

You decide to build the library using the Simple Factory pattern and use dynamic
imports.

Write the library and provide a simple test program for it. (It is not necessary
to fully implement the send_invoice method.  Any indication that it is called
is sufficient.)
