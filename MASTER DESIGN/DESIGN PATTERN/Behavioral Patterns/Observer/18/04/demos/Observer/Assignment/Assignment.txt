In the classic observer pattern, state values are pulled from the subject
by the observer.  It is also possible to push values from the subject
to each observer when state changes.

The AbsSubject abstract base class that is used in this module has
support for operating in push mode.  

Modify the ContextObserver solution to operate in push mode.
