For the final demo in this module, we'll reuse the Order class from before and make a small modification to the ShippingCost class.  This time, ShippingCost expects a callable function instead of an object implementing AbsStrategy.

When the shipping_cost method is called, it in turn calls the strategy function passed in at instantiation time.

In the main module, functions and lambdas will replace the strategy objects used before.

Here the fedex_strategy is defined as a function that simply returns the value 4.  The ups_strategy is defined using lambda syntax, though this is not considered the best Python style.

Then, for the Postal Service test, another lambda is used, this time directly in the instantiation of the ShippingCost object.

As before, if everything works as expected, a "Tests passed" message is printed.  I guess I'd better run this to see if I get that message!

It worked!  So here is a variation of the strategy pattern, using functions and lambdas instead of class definitions.
