/**
Partition List |  Medium | Amazon, Microsoft |

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
 */


class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        ListNode dummy1 = new ListNode(0), dummy2 = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode curr1 = dummy1, curr2 = dummy2;

        while (head != null) {
            if (head.val < x) {
                curr1.next = head;
                curr1 = head;
            } else {
                curr2.next = head;
                curr2 = head;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }

        curr2.next = null;
        curr1.next = dummy2.next;
        return dummy1.next;
    }
}
